# The incredible state machine

To start:

```
npm install
npm run app
```

Tests:

```
npm run test
```

## Approach

I chose to do the CLI approach for user input and output. I've not done an interactive CLI app in a long, long time. It was a really interesting experience solving the problem of a runtime with user interupts and events combined with the management of a timer component as well.
Up front planning:

- State management
- Testing on the `process.input` level.
- Timers and possible drift.
- Very large numbers with the FIB aspect.
