- 1. You have a new requirement to implement for your application: its logic should stay
     exactly the same but it will need to have a different user interface (e.g. if you wrote a
     web app, a different UI may be a REPL).
     Please describe how you would go about implementing this new UI in your application?
     Would you need to restructure your solution in any way?
- The app should be ported across to react pretty easily.
- Describe in detail how i would wire up event listeners instead of readline listeners.
- Readline out can just go to a div

3. What did you think about this coding test - is there anything youâ€™d suggest in order to
   improve it?
   I got super nervous about what scope to include and ended up over engineering it. I guess a guideline of what quality to aim for would be good.
   Alternatively a statement that says: "This is not intended to be a production level application. If you make any compromises, or have TODOs that you would implement if you had more time, document them in your answer."

   I wasn't sure whether to focus on the timer accuracy, or the IO and state machine, or the BigInt specifics of the fibonacci calculator.
